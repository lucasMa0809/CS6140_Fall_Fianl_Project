# CS6140_Fall_Fianl_Project
This repo is constructed by Tian Ma and Wenyu Pan for CS6140 Machine Learning Fall final project. We used Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset at Kaggle. Here is the link to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/overview.    
Run the ipynb file in the repo as following order:   

 1. EDA
 2. Data clean
 3. Data encoding
 4. Any model with no specific order   

Please note that you can choose either Google drive or save the dataset to "./data" directory. Just be careful about the path in each ipynb file. If you run the files locally, please use the path with "./data" to save and load the processed dataset under correct directory.
