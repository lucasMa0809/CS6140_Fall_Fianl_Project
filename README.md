# CS6140_Fall_Fianl_Project
This repo is constructed for CS6140 Machine Learning Fall final project. We used Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset at Kaggle. Here is the link to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/overview. Please save the dataset in Google drive or under "./data" directory.    

## Team  

- Tian Ma
- Wenyu Pan

## Instruction
Run the ipynb file in the repo as following order:   

 1. EDA
 2. Data clean
 3. Data encoding
 4. Any model with no specific order   

Please note that you can choose either Google drive or save the dataset to "./data" directory. Just be careful about the path in each ipynb file. If you run the files locally, please use the path with "./data" to save and load the processed dataset under correct directory.  

## Models used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- Keras
